<h2>-- My Top 3 Movies --</h2>
<hr />

    <h3>Kill Vol. 1 / Vol. 2</h3>
<p>I consider both titles as one cinematic piece, but script, the story, the music, 
    and vitrually everything about these movies all combine to make one masterpeice.</p>

    <h3>Hero</h3>
<p>Another cinematic masterpiece that uses dazzling action choreo, 
    impeccable sound + music design, with acting and diecting titans.</p>

    <h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>A love story that takes place in the late 1800s on-board the world's "First unsinkable ship" 
    that ends in tragedy.</p>
